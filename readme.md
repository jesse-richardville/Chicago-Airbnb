# Chicago Airbnb Project

## Summary:
This data exploration project used MS Excel and Tableau to analyze Chicago Airbnb listing data to find the most expensive neighborhoods, the most profitable unit type, and the distribution of units based on bedrooms from 9/14/2022 - 9/13/2023, which leads to the conclusion that South Deering is the most expensive Chicago neighborhood (average $385/night), 1 bedrooms are the most popular listing (account for 48.8% of all listings, average $125/night), 2 bedroom units bring in the most revenue ($421,426 in revenue, account for 28.9% of all listings, average $214/night), and summer months are the busiest times of year with spikes around Thanksgiving and Christmas for Airbnb rentals.
